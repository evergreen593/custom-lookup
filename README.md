# custom-lookup
# Project developed as an Excel Addin. As an advanced lookup tool, it provides 2 User Defined Functions to:
# 1. superlookup: lookup the first non-empty cell.
# 2. hyperlookup: lookup all cells that meets the requirement

# For data set:
# A  B
# 1  -
# 2  b
# 3  c
# 1  d

# superlookup should return d, and hyperlookup should return -/d
